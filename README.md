# PBTxParser

It is a Flutter Web Project

## Getting Started

Flutter web is currently in beta stage. Thus, in order to create a Flutter app with web support, you need to be in the beta channel of Flutter.

Shift to the beta channel:
```javascript= 
flutter channel beta
```
Upgrade Flutter:
```javascript= 
flutter upgrade
```
Enable web support:
```javascript= 
flutter config --enable-web
```
open an existing project:
cd to the project file
```javascript= 
flutter run -d chrome
```
Create a new Flutter project:
```javascript= 
flutter create <Name-Of-Project>
```

Returning to the stable channel (or any other) requires calling flutter channel <channel> explicitly.
```javascript=
flutter channel <channel> 
```
